Obfuscar Documentation
======================

.. attention:: Obfuscar 2.2 is now available on NuGet! Please read the
   :doc:`Getting Started <getting-started/index>` instructions for installing
   the latest version from NuGet.

General
-------
Obfuscar is a basic obfuscator for .NET assemblies. It uses massive
overloading to rename metadata in .NET assemblies (including the names of
methods, properties, events, fields, types and namespaces) to a minimal set,
distinguishable in most cases only by signature.

For example, if a class contains only methods that accept different
parameters, they can all be renamed 'A'. If another method is added to the
class that accepts the same parameters as an existing method, it could be
named 'a'.

It makes decompiled code very difficult to follow. The wiki has more details
about What It Does.

The current release is Obfuscar 2.x. This is a port of Obfuscar 1.5.4 to the
latest Mono.Cecil library. There were a lot of subtle changes in Cecil's new API
and patches merged from different sources.

.. note:: Since version 1.5 the attrib attribute is evaluated correctly. Be
   sure to check if there are any unintended attrib values from the example in
   your configuration file.

Its source code can be found at GitHub,

Obfuscar works its magic with the help of Jb Evain's fantastic Mono Cecil
library.
